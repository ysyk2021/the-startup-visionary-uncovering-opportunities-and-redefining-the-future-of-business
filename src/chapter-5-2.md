Dealing with Setbacks and Maintaining Resilience in Visionary Efforts
================================================================================

In the world of visionary entrepreneurship, setbacks are inevitable. They can arise from various sources such as market fluctuations, technological challenges, or unforeseen circumstances. It is how entrepreneurs respond to these setbacks that distinguishes them as true visionaries.

The Nature of Setbacks
----------------------

Setbacks are not only a test of an entrepreneur's abilities but also an opportunity for growth.
